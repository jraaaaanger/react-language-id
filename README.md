#Do You Speak?

Do You Speak is a single-page web app written in React.js which uses the Google Translate API to identify whatever language entered by the user. As the user types, the app makes calls to the API after every keystroke, and returns the language, as well as the level of certainty provided by Google. This app was developed as a way for me to practice and become familiar with React.js, as well as to understand consuming external APIs.

Do You Speak was formerly live at do-you-speak.herokuapp.com, but is no longer live as the Google Translate API trial key has since expired. If a new API key is provided, the app will work live locally. It is currently configured only to work in development through webpack dev server.
